Explanation:
As I was not able to find this great map 
anywhere on internet, I made a decision to 
create a re-pack package of the map (along 
with original .txt from .bsp) and upload it 
on various css community websites, so more 
people can enjoy this great map created by 
WildCat.


Have Fun!
