Background: The left wing party lost the elections.
Not coping well with the loss, some members decide to stage
several bombings to disrupt the normal way of life in the town,
and put the ruling party in a tight spot. So far, 2 targets
have been identified: the town hall and the church.
 
Counter-Terrorists: The town monuments and the reputation of
the ruling party must remain intact. 
Prevent the terrorists from destroying the town hall (Palazzo 
comunale) or the church (Duomo). Eliminate all hostiles in the way.

Terrorists: It is very crucial to carry out the bombings in order to
destabilize the town and the ruling party.
The Terrorist carrying the C4 explosive must destroy one of the
bomb targets.
 
Other Notes: There are 2 bomb sites in this mission.
